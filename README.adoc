This plugin allows to upload a file to your Google Drive folder. Currently it
does not support downloading of files and uploading to Team drives and the
domain corpus, but you are welcome to show your interest in the
https://github.com/valnaumov/gradle-google-drive-plugin/issues/1[corresponding
issue] or to provide a PR.

= Obtaining credentials
. Go to https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=drive[Google
  API Console] and create a project.
. Go to https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials[Credentials
section] of just created project.
. Choose Create credentials → OAuth client id → Other. Copy the id and
the secret.

You have to provide the values to an extension with name `googleDrive` inside
the build script. You may do this anyway you like: get from an environment
variable, system property if you'd like, or from a
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:gradle_properties_and_system_properties[`gradle.properties`],
which is the most convenient to me.

= Usage

By default, the plugin applies a task named 'uploadToDrive' which expects an
extension named `googleDrive` to be defined, like so:

```
plugins {
    id 'ru.kinca.google-drive-uploader' version '1.0.0'
}

googleDrive {
    // Missing folders will be created
    destinationFolder = 'test/upload'

    // If not specified, simple file name is used
    destinationName = 'cute_picture.jpg'

    file = file('c:\\Users\\User\\Pictures\\kittens.jpg')

    // Default is true
    updateIfExists = false

    // Do not put those directly into the build file
    clientId  = '<YOUR CLIENT ID>'
    clientSecret = '<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>'
}
```

NOTE: If no permissions were set explicitly, the file will be publicly shared
for reading.

Execute `uploadToDrive` task to perform the upload.

When updating an existing file, the specified permissions will be set, but
existing ones would stay untouched.

== Setting custom permissions
```
import com.google.api.services.drive.model.Permission

googleDrive {
    // Other properties configured...
    permissions = [new Permission()
                       .setType('user')
                       .setEmailAddress('example@gmail.com')
                       .setRole('writer')]
}
```

= Example

.settings.gradle
----
rootProject.name = 'example-app'
----

.build.gradle
----
plugins {
    id 'ru.kinca.google-drive-uploader' version '1.0.0'
    id 'application'
}

mainClassName = 'ru.kinca.example.App'

googleDrive {
    destinationFolder = 'myapp/distributions'

    file = files(distZip).singleFile
    clientId = driveClientId
    clientSecret = driveClientSecret
}
uploadToDrive.dependsOn distZip
----

The application distribution will be packed to a ZIP-file and uploaded to
`myapp/distributions/example-app.zip` and shared publicly for reading.
